## population dynamics models using R

This is a port of the population dynamics models GUI I previously made using `PBSmodelling` in R. See [my original blog post](http://www.alexchubaty.com/2011/08/07/exploring-population-dynamics-models-using-a-gui-for-r.html) for the code and instructions.

I've moved over to `shiny` apps because they are easier for the students to use. They're also prettier.
